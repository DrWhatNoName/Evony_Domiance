Evony Dominance
==============

A complex algorithm to calculate dominance in evony.

The idea of this webapp is to generate a JSON table of real time statistics to determine which alliance effectively dominates which state.

This project will use data provided by the emap project by Daisy and will use data like:
Members Present in states, Flats and valleys held in a state, members in truce and holiday, honor and City captures.

Using this data, i hope we are able to generate a pretty accurate table of state by state dominance.

The json table will then be used to create a series of graphs, Later along the line i how to make an interactive javascript map.
